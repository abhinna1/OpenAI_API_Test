## About OpenAI API [ Generated by ChatGPT (A Generative AI tool developed by OpenAI) ]

The OpenAI API is an artificial intelligence platform that provides developers with access to state-of-the-art natural language processing models, including GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3). The API is designed to be easy to use, with a simple interface that allows developers to quickly integrate it into their applications.

With the OpenAI API, developers can build applications that can understand natural language, generate human-like text, and even perform language translation. The API uses deep learning algorithms to analyze text and generate responses, making it a powerful tool for a wide range of applications, from chatbots to content creation.

One of the key benefits of the OpenAI API is its scalability. Developers can use the API to build applications that can handle large volumes of text data, making it an ideal tool for businesses that need to process large amounts of data quickly.

The OpenAI API is also highly customizable, with a wide range of options for developers to tweak the parameters of the models. This allows developers to fine-tune the models to their specific needs, ensuring that they get the best possible results.

In addition, the OpenAI API is designed to be secure and reliable, with strong encryption and strict access controls to ensure that sensitive data is protected at all times.

Overall, the OpenAI API is a powerful tool that provides developers with access to cutting-edge natural language processing technology. With its ease of use, scalability, and customization options, it has the potential to transform the way we interact with machines and build intelligent applications in a wide range of industries.

## How to setup this project?

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run npm install to install all the dependencies.
3. Generate your OpenAI API Key from OpenAI's official website.
4. Create a .env file and create an environment variable API_SECRET_KEY.
5. Run the index.js file using Node JS. ( <strong>" node index "</strong> in terminal )

## Structure
>
> The index.js file consists the configuration of the npm OpenAI module. The max_token parameter refers to the number of words you want to generate. Similarly, the prompt can also be changed to anything you want. The output is generated as a response to your prompt message.
